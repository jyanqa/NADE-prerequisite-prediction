"Playing a role as an annotator, you have to assign label 0 or 1 to each pairs of these learning concepts. Is learning concept 1 a prerequisite of learning concept 2? (i.e. In order to understand the learning concept 2, is it required to know learning concept 1 in advanced). Yes =  1, No = 0, if you do not know the relationship of any pair, just leave the box empty",,,,,,,
