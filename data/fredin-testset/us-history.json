castle or the walls of his city , into which they fled in times of danger from invaders .", "id_1": "Thus , although they were technically free , serfs were effectively bound to the land they worked ,

continent of isolated regions , each with its own dialect; in the early Middle Ages , nations as we know them today did not yet exist .", "id_7": "The year 622 brought a new challenge to Christendom
