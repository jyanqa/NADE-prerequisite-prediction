{"documents": {"id_0": "A precipitation reaction is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products .", "id_1": "Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement , double replacement , or metathesis reactions .", "id_2": "Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques , including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric methods for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter) .", "id_3": "The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water , or any solvent , is quantitatively expressed as its solubility , defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions .", "id_4": "For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation reactions , one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that have been observed for many ionic compounds .", "id_5": "A vivid example of precipitation is observed when solutions of potassium iodide and lead nitrate are mixed , resulting in the formation of solid lead iodide: This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble compound among all those involved is lead iodide , one of the exceptions to the general solubility of iodide salts .", "id_6": "An acid-base reaction is one in which a hydrogen ion , H+ , is transferred from one chemical species to another .", "id_7": "The subject of acid-base chemistry , therefore , is worthy of thorough discussion , and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the text .", "id_8": "The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water will undergo this reaction .", "id_9": "Acids that completely react in this fashion are called strong acids , and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are classified as strong .", "id_10": "A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid , the main ingredient in food vinegars: A base is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions , OH\u2212 .", "id_11": "For example , global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric tons annually , being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer , a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds , and an active ingredient in household cleaners .", "id_12": "Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide , Al(OH)3 , as an active ingredient .", "id_13": "Earth\u2019s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen , O2 , a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world .", "id_14": "Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number .", "id_15": "In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride , sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to \u22121 in NaCl) .", "id_16": "A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium perchlorate is represented by this equation: Watch a brief video showing the test firing of a small-scale , prototype , hybrid rocket engine planned for use in the new Space Launch System being developed by NASA .", "id_17": "The first engines firing at3 s (green flame) use a liquid fuel/oxidant mixture , and the second , more powerful engines firing at 4 s (yellow flame) use a solid mixture .", "id_18": "Single-displacement (replacement) reactions are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element .", "id_19": "Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire , and the resulting Cu2+ ions dissolve in the solution to yield a characteristic blue color .", "id_20": "Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process .", "id_21": "Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen .", "id_22": "Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions .", "id_23": "For reactions occurring in basic media (excess hydroxide ions) , carry out these additional steps: Add OH\u2212 ions to both sides of the equation in numbers equal to the number of H+ ions .", "id_24": "In the seventeenth century , Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together .", "id_25": "Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework , scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework .", "id_26": "Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation .", "id_27": "A wave is an oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to another .", "id_28": "Common examples of waves are all around us .", "id_29": "The product of a wave's wavelength (\u03bb) and its frequency (\u03bd) , \u03bb\u03bd , is the speed of the wave .", "id_30": "For example , radio waves are usually specified as frequencies (typically in units of MHz) , while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms) .", "id_31": "In FM radio , by contrast , the amplitude is constant and the instantaneous frequency varies .", "id_32": "Other technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .", "id_33": "For example , 4G cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz , while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals operate at 1 .", "id_34": "One particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other .", "id_35": "The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength , with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits .", "id_36": "6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference) , while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference) .", "id_37": "Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics .", "id_38": "In 1969 , she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin , facilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients worldwide .", "id_39": "Not all waves are travelling waves .", "id_40": "Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane , the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional , since it lies along the length of the string .", "id_41": "This is an example of quantization , in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed .", "id_42": "Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion .", "id_43": "An example of two-dimensional standing waves is shown in Figure 6 .", "id_44": "A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures .", "id_45": "This became known as the \u201cultraviolet catastrophe\u201d because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior .", "id_46": "The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the photoelectric effect .", "id_47": "It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it .", "id_48": "9 , sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye .", "id_49": "Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light .", "id_50": "Each emission line consists of a single wavelength of light , which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies .", "id_51": "Even more puzzling , in 1885 , Johann Balmer was able to derive an empirical equation that related the four visible wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms to whole integers ."}, "gold_entities": [["id_0", 2, 22, "Precipitation (chemistry)"], ["id_0", 41, 20, "Solution (chemistry)"], ["id_0", 90, 14, "Solid"], ["id_1", 52, 4,
