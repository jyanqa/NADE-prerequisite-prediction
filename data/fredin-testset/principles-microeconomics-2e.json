banks or bonds; and (4) by selling stock .", "id_1": "Such firms face a difficult problem when it comes to raising financial capital: How can a firm that has not yet demonstrated any ability to earn profits pay a rate of return to financial investors ?", "id_2": "Firms have two main borrowing methods: banks and bonds .", "id_3": "The firm borrows an amount of money and then promises to repay it , including some rate of interest , over a predetermined period of time .", "id_4": "A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .", "id_5": "A firm seeks to borrow $50 million by issuing bonds , might actually issue 10 , 000 bonds of $5 , 000 each .", "id_6": "If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .", "id_7": "However , there is no guarantee the firm will have sufficient assets to pay off the bonds .", "id_8": "Bank borrowing is more customized than issuing bonds , so it often works better for relatively small firms .", "id_9": "Relatively large and well-known firms often issue bonds instead .", "id_10": "However , the idea that firms or individuals use banks for relatively smaller loans and bonds for larger loans is not an ironclad rule: sometimes groups of banks make large loans and sometimes relatively small and lesser-known firms issue bonds .", "id_11": "A corporation is a business that \u201cincorporates\u201d\u2014that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the company's debt but share in its profits (and losses) .", "id_12": "Those who buy the stock become the firm's owners , or shareholders .", "id_13": "For one , the IPO , and any stock issued thereafter , such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own treasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering , provides the funds to repay the early-stage investors , like the angel investors and the venture capital firms .", "id_14": "A venture capital firm may have a 40% ownership in the firm .", "id_15": "When the firm sells stock , the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to the public .", "id_16": "A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with financial capital for substantially expanding its operations .", "id_17": "That rate of return can come in two forms .", "id_18": "Individuals can run a private company .", "id_19": "A private company can also be a corporation , but with no publicly issued stock .", "id_20": "Shareholders own a public company .", "id_21": "Since the shareholders are a very broad group , often consisting of thousands or even millions of investors , the shareholders vote for a board of directors , who in turn hire top executives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis .", "id_22": "In theory , the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm runs in the interests of the true owners\u2014the shareholders .", "id_23": "After all , few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have enough personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative board members .", "id_24": "The board of directors , elected by the shareholders , is supposed to be the first line of corporate governance and oversight for top executives .", "id_25": "As a firm becomes at least somewhat established and its strategy appears likely to lead to profits in the near future , knowing the individual managers and their business plans on a personal basis becomes less important , because information has become more widely available regarding the company\u2019s products , revenues , costs , and profits .", "id_26": "The great disadvantage of borrowing money from a bank or issuing bonds is that the firm commits to scheduled interest payments , whether or not it has sufficient income .",

potential payoffs is reasonably probable .", "id_31": "3 illustrates the position of banks as a financial intermediary , with a pattern of deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out , and then repayment of the loans flowing back to the bank , with interest payments for the original savers .", "id_32": "The bottom line on bank accounts looks like this: low risk means low rate of return but high liquidity .", "id_33": "We always can divide an interest rate into three components (as we explained in Choice in a World of Scarcity): compensation for delaying consumption , an adjustment for an inflationary rise in the overall level of prices , and a risk premium that takes the borrower\u2019s riskiness into account .", "id_34": "Firms that appear to be safe borrowers , perhaps because of their sheer size or because they have consistently earned profits over time , will still pay a higher interest rate than the U .", "id_35": "Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .", "id_36": "A number of today\u2019s well-known firms issued junk bonds in the

expected to pay over time .", "id_44": "When buying a bond that has been around for a few years , investors should know that the interest rate printed on a bond is often not the same as the bond yield , even on new bonds .", "id_45": "This makes the bond an unattractive investment , since an investor can find another bond that perhaps pays 12% .", "id_46": "To induce the investor to buy the 8% bond , the bond seller will lower its price below its face value of $1 , 000 .", "id_47": "Given that interest rates are now 12% , you know that you could invest $964 in an alternative investment and

"The yield , or total return , means interest payments , plus capital gains .", "id_50": "Note that the interest or coupon rate of 8% did not change .", "id_51": "Conversely , when interest rates fall

in New York City .", "id_61": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the price weighted average of 30 industrial stocks tracked on the New York Stock Exchange .", "id_62": "The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies and also capital gains arising from increases in the stock value .", "id_63": "In the 1960s and 1970s , the gap between percent earned on capital gains and dividends was much closer than it has been since the 1980s .", "id_64": "The overall pattern is that stocks as a group have provided a high rate of return over extended periods of time , but this return comes with risks .", "id_65": "The stock market can sometimes fall sharply , as it did in 2008 .", "id_66": "At the other end of the spectrum , a mutual fund might be quite broad .", "id_67": "At the extreme , some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the mutual fund's value will fluctuate with the overall stock market's average .", "id_68": "This steep drop in value hit hardest those who were close to retirement and were counting on their stock funds to supplement retirement income .", "id_69": "The risks are also high , but the risks and returns for an individual mutual fund will be lower than those for an individual stock .", "id_70": "For example , imagine that you buy a house for $200 , 000 , paying 10% of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $180 , 000 .", "id_71": "Over time , you pay off some of your bank loan , so that only $100 , 000 remains , and the house's value on the market rises to $250 , 000 .", "id_72": "Investment in a house is tangibly different from bank accounts , stocks , and bonds because a house offers both a financial and a nonfinancial return .", "id_73": "However , the possible capital gains from rising housing prices are riskier than these national price averages .", "id_74": "Banks became much more flexible in their lending , making what were called \u201csubprime\u201d loans .", "id_75": "The idea was that housing prices would keep rising , so the borrower would just refinance the mortgage two years in the future , and thus would not ever have to make the higher payments .", "id_76": "In hindsight , it appears that the credit agencies were far too lenient in their ratings of many of the securitized loans .", "id_77": "Bank and financial regulators watched the steady rise in the market for mortgage-backed securities , but saw no reason at the time to intervene .", "id_78": "When housing prices turned down , many households that had borrowed when prices were high found that what they owed the bank was more than what their home was worth .", "id_79": "After all , banks thought back in 2005 , the average house price had not declined at any time since the Great Depression in the 1930s .", "id_80": "If risky assets like stocks did not also offer a higher average return , then few investors would want them .", "id_81": "The high returns of stock market investments refer to a high average return that we can expect over a period of several years or decades ."}, "gold_entities": [["id_0", 20, 17, "Financial capital"],
